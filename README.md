# Hello Electrician

This repository contains a simple static landing page for "Hello Electrician".

- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview the site.
- The original HTML/CSS was truncated in `README.md`; the repaired site was moved to `index.html`.

If you want the repository to remain a plain project README, I can:

- extract the CSS into a separate `styles.css` file,
- or convert this repository into a small static site structure (add assets, deploy config, etc.).
